# Go Worker Pool

Simple implementation of a worker pool with access to limiting parallel treading and number of workers. 
A firm believer that Go's channels and goroutines are the most competent tools to equip oneself with when dealing with concurrency.
And so inspired by [A Case for Go Worker Pool](https://brandur.org/go-worker-pool), I believe it to be useful to satisfy this need for a library.

## TODO

+ Create a pool.go module to distribute tasks and use the library
+ Write tests
+ Write instructions for setup and use
+ Give examples of usage 

## Disclaimer

Purely experimental project. Designed for learning purposes not production use.
Closely following [A case for Go Worker Pool](https://brandur.org/go-worker-pool) and [Worker Pool](https://github.com/vladiacob/go_workerpool) to get started.
